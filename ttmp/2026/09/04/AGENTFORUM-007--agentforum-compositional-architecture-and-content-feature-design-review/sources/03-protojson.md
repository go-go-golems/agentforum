Protobuf supports a canonical encoding in JSON, making it easier to share data with systems that do not support the standard protobuf binary wire format.

This page specifies the format, but a number of additional edge cases which define a conformant ProtoJSON parser are covered in the Protobuf Conformance Test Suite and are not exhaustively detailed here.

## Non-goals of the Format

### Cannot Represent Some JSON schemas

The ProtoJSON format is designed to be a JSON representation of schemas which are expressible in the Protobuf schema language.

It may be possible to represent many pre-existing JSON schemas as a Protobuf schema and parse it using ProtoJSON, but it is not designed to be able to represent arbitrary JSON schemas.

For example, there is no way to express in Protobuf schema to write types that may be common in JSON schemas like `number[][]` or `number|string`.

It is possible to use `google.protobuf.Struct` and `google.protobuf.Value` types to allow arbitrary JSON to be parsed into a Protobuf schema, but these only allow you to capture the values as schemaless unordered key-value maps.

### Not as efficient as the binary wire format

ProtoJSON Format is not as efficient as binary wire format and never will be.

The converter uses more CPU to encode and decode messages and (except in rare cases) encoded messages consume more space.

### Does not have as good schema-evolution guarantees as binary wire format

ProtoJSON format does not support unknown fields, and it puts field and enum value names into encoded messages which makes it much harder to change those names later. Removing fields is a breaking change that will trigger a parsing error.

See [JSON Wire Safety](#json-wire-safety) below for more details.

## Format Description

### Representation of each type

The following table shows how data is represented in JSON files.

| Protobuf type | JSON | JSON example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| message | object | `{"fooBar": v, "g": null, ...}` | Generates JSON objects.  Keys are serialized as lowerCamelCase of field name. See [Field Names](#field-names) for more special cases regarding mapping of field names to object keys.  Well-known types have special representations, as described in the [Well-known types table](#wkt).  `null` is valid for any field and leaves the field unset. See [Null Values](#null-values) for clarification about the semantic behavior of null values. |
| enum | string | `"FOO_BAR"` | The name of the enum value as specified in proto is used. Parsers accept both enum names and integer values. See [Enum Aliasing](#enum-aliasing) for details on enums with aliases. |
| map<K,V> | object | `{"k": v, ...}` | All keys are converted to strings (object keys in JSON can only be strings). |
| repeated V | array | `[v, ...]` |  |
| bool | true, false | `true, false` |  |
| string | string | `"Hello World!"` |  |
| bytes | base64 string | `"YWJjMTIzIT8kKiYoKSctPUB+"` | JSON value will be the data encoded as a string using standard base64 encoding with paddings. Either standard or URL-safe base64 encoding with/without paddings are accepted. |
| int32, fixed32, uint32 | number | `1, -10, 0` | JSON value will be a number. Either numbers or strings are accepted. Empty strings are invalid. Exponent notation (such as `1e2`) is accepted in both quoted and unquoted forms. |
| int64, fixed64, uint64 | string | `"1", "-10"` | JSON value will be a decimal string. Either numbers or strings are accepted. Empty strings are invalid. Exponent notation (such as `1e2`) is accepted in both quoted and unquoted forms. See [Strings for int64s](#int64-strings) for the explanation why strings are used for int64s. |
| float, double | number | `1.1, -10.0, 0, "NaN", "Infinity"` | JSON value will be a number or one of the special string values "NaN", "Infinity", and "-Infinity". Either numbers or strings are accepted. Empty strings are invalid. Exponent notation is also accepted. |

### Well-Known Types

Some messages in the `google.protobuf` package have a special representation when represented in JSON.

No message type outside of the `google.protobuf` package has a special ProtoJSON handling; for example, types in `google.types` package are represented with the neutral representation.

| Message type | JSON | JSON example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any | `object` | `{"@type": "url", "f": v, ... }` | See [Any](#any) |
| Timestamp | string | `"1972-01-01T10:00:20.021Z"` | Uses RFC 3339 (see [clarification](#rfc3339-timestamp)). Generated output will always be Z-normalized with 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. |
| Duration | string | `"1.000340012s", "1s"` | Generated output always contains 0, 3, 6, or 9 fractional digits, depending on required precision, followed by the suffix "s". Accepted are any fractional digits (also none) as long as they fit into nanoseconds precision and the suffix "s" is required. This is **not** RFC 3339 'duration' format (see [Durations](#rfc3339-duration) for clarification). |
| Struct | `object` | `{ ... }` | Any JSON object. See `struct.proto`. |
| Wrapper types | various types | `2, "2", "foo", true, "true", null, 0, ...` | Wrappers use the same representation in JSON as the wrapped primitive type, except that `null` is allowed and preserved during data conversion and transfer. |
| FieldMask | string | `"f.fooBar,h"` | See `field_mask.proto`. Note that some field names cannot be represented in JSON FieldMasks, see [FieldMask Round-trip Limitations](#fieldmask-limitations). |
| ListValue | array | `[foo, bar, ...]` |  |
| Value | value |  | Any JSON value. Check [google.protobuf.Value](/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf#value) for details. |
| NullValue | null |  | JSON null. Special case of the [null parsing behavior](#null-values). |
| Empty | object | `{}` **(not special cased)** | An empty JSON object |

### Field names as JSON keys

Message field names are mapped to lowerCamelCase to be used as JSON object keys. If the `json_name` field option is specified, the specified value will be used as the key instead.

Parsers accept both the lowerCamelCase name (or the one specified by the `json_name` option) and the original proto field name. This allows for a serializer option to choose to print using the original field name (see [JSON Options](#json-options)) and have the resulting output still be parsed back by all spec parsers.

`\0 (nul)` is not allowed within a `json_name` value. For more on why, see [Stricter validation for json\_name](/news/2023-04-28#json-name). Note that `\0` is still considered a legal character within the value of a `string` field.

### Presence and default-values

When generating JSON-encoded output from a protocol buffer, if a field supports presence, serializers must emit the field value if and only if the corresponding hazzer would return true.

If the field doesn’t support field presence and has the default value (for example any empty repeated field) serializers should omit it from the output. An implementation may provide options to include fields with default values in the output.

### Null values

Serializers should not emit `null` values.

Parsers accept `null` as a legal value for any field, with the following behavior:

- Any key validity checking should still occur (disallowing unknown fields).
- The field should remain unset, as though it was not present in the input at all (hazzers should still return false where applicable).

The implication of this is that a `null` value for an implicit presence field will behave the identically to the behavior to the default value of that field, since there are no hazzers for those fields. For example, a value of `null` or `[]` for a repeated field will cause key-validation checks, but both will otherwise behave the same as if the field was not present in the JSON at all.

`null` values are not allowed within repeated fields.

`google.protobuf.NullValue` is a special exception to this behavior: `null` is handled as a sentinel-present value for this type, and so a field of this type must be handled by serializers and parsers under the standard presence behavior. This behavior correspondingly allows `google.protobuf.Struct` and `google.protobuf.Value` to losslessly round trip arbitrary JSON.

### Duplicate keys

ProtoJSON is built on top of JSON. Unfortunately, JSON does not have established consistent behavior in the face of duplicate keys in one JSON object. For example, [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-4) notes that names within a JSON object SHOULD be unique, but notes that behaviors diverge when they are not. Some parsers fail, but most have last-wins semantics (matching browsers). Furthermore, JSON parsers may or may not preserve the original key ordering information.

ProtoJSON introduces additional complexity because duplicate fields can occur not only from verbatim identical keys, but also from:

- Alternate spellings of the same field name (e.g., `camelCase` vs `snake_case`).
- Two different fields that belong to the same `oneof`.

To resolve these ambiguities, ProtoJSON defines the following behaviors:

- **Serializers**: A conforming ProtoJSON serializer **MUST NOT** emit duplicate keys (including multiple fields within the same `oneof`).
- **Parsers**:
	- “Last wins” behavior should be used in all cases where possible.
		- This natural outcome when the implementation builds on top of an off-the-shelf JSON parser that exhibits last-key-wins behavior.
		- If using a JSON parser which is able to retain original field order, alternate spellings of keys and two different fields within the same oneof should also be “last wins”.
	- Wherever it is not practical to implement “last wins”, the parse must fail rather than selecting one to win arbitrarily.
		- In the common case of a ProtoJSON parser built using a JSON parser which implements “last wins” on exact keys but does not maintain order in the resulting object, the behavior should be “last wins” for exact duplicate keys and parse failure on duplicate alternate spellings or two fields within the same oneof.

Any other behavior (including first-wins or arbitrary-one-wins or merge of the fields) should not be used. However, since a range of behaviors is considered permissible by the underlying JSON specs, it is strongly recommended that systems avoid relying on any specific handling of duplicates in ProtoJSON.

### Out of range numeric values

When parsing a numeric value, if the number that is is parsed from the wire doesn’t fit in the corresponding type, the parser should fail to parse.

This includes any negative number for `uint32`, and numbers less than `INT_MIN` or larger than `INT_MAX` for `int32`.

Values with nonzero fractional portions are not allowed for integer-typed fields. Zero fractional portions are accepted. For example `1.0` is valid for an int32 field, but `1.5` is not.

### Strings for int64

Unfortunately, the [json.org](https://json.org) spec does not speak to the intended precision limits of numbers. Many implementations follow the original JS behavior that JSON was derived from and interpret all numbers as binary64 (double precision) and are silently lossy if a number is an integer larger than 2\*\*53. Other implementations may support unlimited precision bigints, int64s, or even bigfloats with unlimited fractional precision.

This creates a situation where if the JSON contains a number that is not exactly representable by double precision, different parsers will behave differently, including silent precision loss in many languages.

To avoid these problems, ProtoJSON serializers emit int64s as strings to ensure no precision loss will occur on large int64s by any implementation.

When parsing a bare number when expecting an int64, the implementation should coerce that value to double-precision even if the corresponding language’s built-in JSON parser supports parsing of JSON numbers as bigints. This ensures a consistent interpretation of the same data, regardless of language used.

This design follows established best practices in how to handle large numbers in JSON when prioritizing interoperability, including:

- [RFC8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-6) includes a note that software that intends good interoperability should only presume double precision on all numbers.
- [OpenAPI int64](https://spec.openapis.org/registry/format/int64) documentation recommends using a JSON string instead of a number when precision beyond 2\*\*53 is desired.

## Enum Aliasing

When an enum definition has `option allow_aliasing = true;`, multiple enum constant names can map to the same numeric value.

### Serialization Behavior

Serializers **must** print the first listed name in the enum definition for a given numeric value.

For example, given:

```proto
enum MyEnum {
  option allow_alias = true;
  UNKNOWN = 0;
  OLD_NAME = 1;
  NEW_NAME = 1;
}
```

If the value is `1`, the serializer will output `"OLD_NAME"`.

### Parsing Behavior

Parsers **must** accept any of the names defined for that numeric value. In the example above, the parser will accept both `"OLD_NAME"` and `"NEW_NAME"` as mapping to value `1`.

### Safe Renaming Strategy

This behavior enables a safe, multi-step migration path for renaming enum values in a distributed system:

1. **Add the new name as an alias:** Add the new name below the old name, mapping to the same value.
	```proto
	enum MyEnum {
	  option allow_aliasing = true;
	  UNKNOWN = 0;
	  OLD_NAME = 1;
	  NEW_NAME = 1; // New name added as alias
	}
	```
2. **Deploy the schema:** Deploy this schema to all systems. At this point, all parsers will recognize both `OLD_NAME` and `NEW_NAME`, but all serializers will still emit `OLD_NAME` (since it is listed first).
3. **Swap the order:** Swap the order of the aliases in the proto file.
	```proto
	enum MyEnum {
	  option allow_aliasing = true;
	  UNKNOWN = 0;
	  NEW_NAME = 1; // New name is now first
	  OLD_NAME = 1;
	}
	```
4. **Deploy the schema:** Deploy this updated schema. Now, serializers will begin emitting `NEW_NAME`. Parsers will still accept both names, ensuring that any systems still running the previous version of the schema can safely parse the new name.
5. **Remove the old name:** Once all systems have been updated and you are sure no old serialized data remains that needs to be parsed by a system that might be rolled back, you can safely remove the old name.
	```proto
	enum MyEnum {
	  UNKNOWN = 0;
	  NEW_NAME = 1;
	}
	```

This semantic also matches TextProto for the same reason.

## Any

### Normal messages

For any message that is not a well-known type with a special JSON representation, the message contained inside the `Any` is turned into a JSON object with an additional `"@type"` field inserted that contains the `type_url` that was set on the `Any`.

For example, if you have this message definition:

```proto
package x;
message Child { int32 x = 1; string y = 2; }
```

When an instance of Child is packed into an `Any`, the JSON representation is:

```json
{
  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/x.Child",
  "x": 1,
  "y": "hello world"
}
```

### Special-cased well-known types

If the `Any` contains a well-known type that has a special JSON mapping, the message is converted into the special representation and set as a field with key “value”.

For example, a `google.protobuf.Duration` that represents 3.1 seconds will be represented by the string `"3.1s"` in the special case handling. When that `Duration` is packed into an `Any` it will be serialized as:

```json
{
  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
  "value": "3.1s"
}
```

Message types with special JSON encodings include:

- `google.protobuf.Any`
- `google.protobuf.BoolValue`
- `google.protobuf.BytesValue`
- `google.protobuf.DoubleValue`
- `google.protobuf.Duration`
- `google.protobuf.FieldMask`
- `google.protobuf.FloatValue`
- `google.protobuf.Int32Value`
- `google.protobuf.Int64Value`
- `google.protobuf.ListValue`
- `google.protobuf.StringValue`
- `google.protobuf.Struct`
- `google.protobuf.Timestamp`
- `google.protobuf.UInt32Value`
- `google.protobuf.UInt64Value`
- `google.protobuf.Value`

Note that `google.protobuf.Empty` is not considered to have any special JSON mapping; it is simply a normal message that has zero fields. This means the expected representation of an `Empty` packed into an `Any` is `{"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Empty"}` and not `{"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Empty", "value": {}}`.

## ProtoJSON Wire Safety

When using ProtoJSON, only some schema changes are safe to make in a distributed system. This contrasts with the same concepts applied to the [the binary wire format](/programming-guides/editions#updating).

### JSON Wire-unsafe Changes

Wire-unsafe changes are schema changes that will break if you parse data that was serialized using the old schema with a parser that is using the new schema (or vice versa). You should almost never do this shape of schema change.

- Changing a field to or from an extension of same number and type is not safe.
- Changing a field between `string` and `bytes` is not safe.
- Changing a field between a message type and `bytes` is not safe.
- Changing any field from `optional` to `repeated` is not safe.
- Changing a field between a `map<K, V>` and the corresponding `repeated` message field is not safe.
- Moving fields into an existing `oneof` is not safe.

### JSON Wire-safe Changes

Wire-safe changes are ones where it is fully safe to evolve the schema in this way without risk of data loss or new parse failures.

Note that nearly all wire-safe changes may be a breaking change to application code. For example, adding a value to a preexisting enum would be a compilation break for any code with an exhaustive switch on that enum. For that reason, Google may avoid making some of these types of changes on public messages. The AIPs contain guidance for which of these changes are safe to make there.

- Changing a single `optional` field into a member of a **new** `oneof` is safe.
- Changing a `oneof` which contains only one field to an `optional` field is safe.
- Changing a field between any of `int32`, `sint32`, `sfixed32`, `fixed32` is safe.
- Changing a field between any of `int64`, `sint64`, `sfixed64`, `fixed64` is safe.
- Changing a field number is safe (as the field numbers are not used in the ProtoJSON format), but still strongly discouraged since it is very unsafe in the binary wire format.
- Adding values to an enum is safe if the “Emit enum values as integers” is set on all relevant clients (see [options](#json-options))

### JSON Wire-compatible Changes (Conditionally safe)

Unlike wire-safe changes, wire-compatible means that the same data can be parsed both before and after a given change. However, a client that reads it will get lossy data under this shape of change. For example, changing an int32 to an int64 is a compatible change, but if a value larger than INT32\_MAX is written, a client that reads it as an int32 will discard the high order bits.

You can make compatible changes to your schema only if you manage the roll out to your system carefully. For example, you may change an int32 to an int64 but ensure you continue to only write legal int32 values until the new schema is deployed to all endpoints, and then start writing larger values after that.

#### Compatible But With Unknown Field Handling Problems

Unlike the binary wire format, ProtoJSON implementations generally do not propagate unknown fields. This means that adding to schemas is generally compatible but will result in parse failures if a client using the old schema observes the new content.

This means you can add to your schema, but you cannot safely start writing them until you know the schema has been deployed to the relevant client or server (or that the relevant clients set an Ignore Unknown Fields flag, discussed [below](#json-options)).

- Adding and removing fields is considered compatible with this caveat.
- Removing enum values is considered compatible with this caveat.

#### Compatible But Potentially Lossy

- Changing between any of the 32-bit integers (`int32`, `uint32`, `sint32`,`sfixed32`, `fixed32`) and any of the 64-bit integers ( `int64`, `uint64`,`sint64`, `sfixed32`) is a compatible change.
	- If a number is parsed from the wire that doesn’t fit in the corresponding type, a parse failure will occur.
	- Unlike binary wire format, `bool` is not compatible with integers.
	- Note that the int64 and uint64 types are quoted by default to avoid precision loss when handled as a double or JavaScript number, and the 32 bit types are unquoted by default. Conformant parsers will accept either quoted or unquoted for all integer types, but nonconformant implementations may mishandle this case and not handle quoted-int32s or unquoted-int64s, so caution should be taken.
- `enum` may be conditionally compatible with `string`
	- If “enums-as-ints” flag is used by any client, then enums will instead be compatible with the integer types instead.

## RFC 3339 Clarifications

ProtoJSON timestamps use the RFC 3339 timestamp format. Unfortunately, some ambiguity in the RFC 3339 spec has created a few edge cases where various other RFC 3339 implementations do not agree on whether or not the format is legal.

[RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) intends to declare a strict subset of ISO-8601 format, and some additional ambiguity was created since RFC 3339 was published in 2002 and then ISO-8601 was subsequently revised without any corresponding revisions of RFC 3339.

Most notably, ISO-8601-1988 contains this note:

> In date and time representations lower case characters may be used when upper case characters are not available.

It is ambiguous whether this note is suggesting that parsers should accept lowercase letters in general, or if it is only suggesting that lowercase letters may be used as a substitute in environments where uppercase cannot be technically used. RFC 3339 contains a note that intends to clarify the interpretation to be that lowercase letters should be accepted in general.

ISO-8601-2019 does not contain the corresponding note and is unambiguous that lowercase letters are not allowed.

This created some confusion for all libraries that declare they support RFC 3339: today RFC 3339 declares it is a profile of ISO-8601 but contains a clarifying note referencing text that is not present in the latest ISO-8601 spec.

ProtoJSON spec takes the decision that the timestamp format is the stricter definition of “RFC 3339 as a profile of ISO-8601-2019”. Some Protobuf implementations may be non-conformant by using a timestamp parsing implementation that is implemented as “RFC 3339 as a profile of ISO-8601-1988,” which will accept a few additional edge cases.

For consistent interoperability, parsers should only accept the stricter subset format where possible. When using a non-conformant implementation that accepts the laxer definition, strongly avoid relying on the additional edge cases being accepted.

### Durations

RFC 3339 also defines a duration format, but unfortunately the RFC 3339 duration format does not have any way to express sub-second resolution.

The ProtoJSON duration encoding is directly inspired by RFC 3339 `dur-seconds` representation, but it is able to encode nanosecond precision. For integer number of seconds the two representations may match (like `10s`), but the ProtoJSON durations accept fractional values and conformant implementations must precisely represent nanosecond precision (like `10.500000001s`).

## Non-Round Trippable Edge cases of Well-Known Types

While ProtoJSON defines canonical JSON representations for all Protocol Buffer types, under some edge cases Well-Known Types are not supported to round-trip cleanly (i.e., deserializing JSON back into proto, or vice versa) due to design bugs in the format.

For example, `google.protobuf.Value` has a double field for JSON numbers. JSON numbers can represent any double except for `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `NaN`; constructing `Value` message with those three values set will result in a message that cannot be round-tripped through the JSON format.

These edge cases are rare. When they occur, implementations may fail to serialize, or they may serialize something that does not parse back to exactly the same as the original value.

### Non-Round Trippable FieldMasks

One of the most significant round-trip limitations is that `google.protobuf.FieldMask` in JSON representation cannot be used to represent field names that are not losslessly convertible between `snake_case` and `camelCase`.

When representing a `FieldMask` in JSON, the original field names are converted from `snake_case` to `lowerCamelCase`. When parsing the JSON `FieldMask` back, the parser has to convert the camelCase path segments back to snake\_case.

However, round-tripping to/from camelCase is not lossless. For example:

- **Field names containing underscores followed by numbers** (e.g., `x_0`,`custom_label_0`): The camelCase representation of `x_0` is `x0`. When converting `x0` back to snake\_case, it remains `x0`, failing to restore the underscore.
- **Field names with consecutive underscores or leading/trailing underscores** (e.g., `_x`, `__foo_bar`, `foo__bar`): The capitalization and restoration rules cannot differentiate these from standard camelCase.

When processing standard fields, ambiguities can be resolved by looking at the field definitions in the specific schema to look for matches. But because `FieldMask` paths are not associated with any specific message type during parsing, the conversion steps cannot refer to the schema. This means that some field names are not round-trip representable.

To avoid issues, follow the standard Protobuf style guide and avoid using underscores followed by numbers or consecutive/leading/trailing underscores. Starting in Edition 2024, these naming patterns are rejected by `protoc` to prevent issues.

## JSON Options

A conformant protobuf JSON implementation may provide the following options:

- **Always emit fields without presence**: Fields that don’t support presence and that have their default value are omitted by default in JSON output (for example, an implicit presence integer with a 0 value, implicit presence string fields that are empty strings, and empty repeated and map fields). An implementation may provide an option to override this behavior and output fields with their default values.
	As of v25.x, the C++, Java, and Python implementations are nonconformant, as this flag affects proto2 `optional` fields but not proto3 `optional` fields. A fix is planned for a future release.
- **Ignore unknown fields**: The protobuf JSON parser should reject unknown fields by default but may provide an option to ignore unknown fields in parsing.
- **Use proto field name instead of lowerCamelCase name**: By default the protobuf JSON printer should convert the field name to lowerCamelCase and use that as the JSON name. An implementation may provide an option to use proto field name as the JSON name instead. Protobuf JSON parsers are required to accept both the converted lowerCamelCase name and the proto field name.
- **Emit enum values as integers instead of strings**: The name of an enum value is used by default in JSON output. An option may be provided to use the numeric value of the enum value instead.
